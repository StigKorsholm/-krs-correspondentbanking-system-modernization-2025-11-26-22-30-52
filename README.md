## All Bounded Contexts

### 💚 Correspondent Relationship Management

- **Type**: core
- **Trinity**: heart
- **BIAN Domains**: Correspondent Bank Relationship
- **Capabilities**: 2
- **Aggregates**: 2
- **File**: `correspondent-relationship-management.md`

Manages the complete lifecycle of correspondent banking relationships, including master data for bank entities, and the authorization rules (RMA) governing message exchange. Acts as the 'HEART' of the correspondent banking domain.

---

### 💾 Settlement Instructions Management

- **Type**: core
- **Trinity**: memory
- **BIAN Domains**: Party Routing Profile
- **Capabilities**: 1
- **Aggregates**: 1
- **File**: `settlement-instructions-management.md`

Manages Standard Settlement Instructions (SSIs), which are the definitive rules for routing payments. This context is the authoritative source for 'how' to pay a counterparty in a specific currency.

---

### 🧠 Nostro Account Management

- **Type**: core
- **Trinity**: brain
- **BIAN Domains**: Correspondent Bank Operations
- **Capabilities**: 1
- **Aggregates**: 1
- **File**: `nostro-account-management.md`

Manages the bank's own accounts held at correspondent banks (Nostro accounts). This includes account details, currency, and operational rules like statement generation thresholds.

---

### 💾 Clearing System Directory

- **Type**: supporting
- **Trinity**: memory
- **BIAN Domains**: None
- **Capabilities**: 1
- **Aggregates**: 1
- **File**: `clearing-system-directory.md`

A specialized reference data context that manages details of payment clearing systems (e.g., TARGET2, Fedwire) and their participants. It isolates this highly stable, technical reference data.

---

### ⚙️ Correspondent Data Gateway

- **Type**: supporting
- **Trinity**: hybrid
- **BIAN Domains**: None
- **Capabilities**: 1
- **Aggregates**: 0
- **File**: `correspondent-data-gateway.md`

Provides a unified, secure, and versioned API gateway for all consumers of correspondent banking data. It handles legacy data format generation and acts as a facade over the domain-specific contexts.

---

### ⚙️ Legacy Integration (Anti-Corruption Layer)

- **Type**: supporting
- **Trinity**: hybrid
- **BIAN Domains**: None
- **Capabilities**: 1
- **Aggregates**: 0
- **File**: `legacy-integration-anti-corruption-layer.md`

Isolates the modernized system from the legacy KRS system during the migration phase. It handles data translation, dual-write coordination, and provides a safety net for rollback.

## How to Use These Canvas Documents

1. **Review each canvas** with your architecture team
2. **Refine ubiquitous language** - Add missing domain terms
3. **Validate aggregates** - Ensure entity boundaries make sense
4. **Check relationships** - Confirm upstream/downstream dependencies
5. **Assign ownership** - Map contexts to development teams
6. **Plan sprints** - Use contexts as units of delivery

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review Canvas v5 documents with stakeholders
- [ ] Create Context Map diagram (visual)
- [ ] Define API contracts between contexts
- [ ] Design database schemas for aggregates
- [ ] Plan migration strategy per context
- [ ] Generate microservices from contexts
